My name is Songchen Jiang. I'm a joint Ph.D student in the College of Information Science and Engineering (ISE), Northeastern University (NEU) (Supervisor: Prof. Min Huang) and the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS) (Supervisor: Prof. Chung Piaw TEO). My research interests include Stochastic programming, Mixed-integer (linear) programming, and their applications in logistics and supply chain systems.
